(Metcalf, 2004)This def i nition does not attempt to redef i ne ‘peoples’, but its meaning is clear regardingthe model and the sort of ‘peoples’ Metcalf intends to cover within this model. Inaddition, this def i nition is consonant with the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples, which includes one of the strongest statements of the rights ofindigenous peoples in the context of international law. 26At fi rst sight it may seem as though the emphasis on environmental land issuesmakes this model quite similar to the ‘cultural integrity’ model discussed above. But inthis model, indigenous peoples’ rights to their lands are based on their rights to controltheir own social life and development. A troubling corollary of this approach is thatthere is, at least in principle, no necessary connection between a group’s free choicesand any ecologically sound policy. However, Article 39 of the UN Draft Declarationstates:Indigenous peoples have the right to have access to and prompt decisions throughmutually acceptable and fair procedures for the resolution of conf l icts and disputeswith States, as well as to effective remedies for all infringements of their individual andcollective rights. Such a decision shall take into consideration the customs, traditions,rules, and legal system of the indigenous peoples concerned.Thus, at least this article recognizes the essential presence of ‘tradition’ and ‘customs’,although it stops short of making the presence of such traditional choices mandatoryin order to legitimize an indigenous people’s or First Nation’s choices.Perhaps this is the most disturbing aspect of this model. If self-determination is theultimate value, aside from any other consideration, then in theory (although most likelynot in practice), an aboriginal group could decide to rent their land to a Monsantoaff i liate, or a chemical company or any other hazardous industry, as long as it was thegeneral will of the people to do",

				["text"] = "I have argued that even negligent harms of the magnitude of these industrialdisasters should be included as ‘crimes against humanity’ (Westra, 2004a). I am wellaware, however, that we are considering lex ferenda, at best. Perhaps the best hope tosee these crimes indicted and properly categorized may eventually be found in thedef i nition of Article 5(d), in the crime of ‘aggression’ (under the provisions of Article121, and 123), as its full extent is, as yet, undef i ned. Similarly, it is not too far-fetched,I believe, to acknowledge with the language of the ‘Preamble’ the presence of ergaomnes obligations, based on jus cogens norms, as applicable to all peoples, as they arein the worst crimes:Recognizing that such grave crimes threaten the peace, security and well-being ofthe world. Aff i rming that the most serious crimes of concern to the internationalcommunity as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecutionmust be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancinginternational cooperation.When one considers the seriousness and the pervasiveness of the harms produced bythe combination of corporate ‘freedom’ to pursue its goals with few restraints, on onehand, and the primacy of trade ‘eff i ciency’ (Heath, 2001), on the other, we discoverthat all human rights are at stake. Even, as Jennifer Downs argues, ‘f i rst generationrights’ (Downs, 1993), which are codif i ed in the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights, 28  while second generation rights refer to the International Covenanton Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 29  are under fi re. Neither fi rst nor secondgeneration rights, ever mention health, either human or ecological, yet according tothe ‘Preamble’ of the latter: ‘The ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom fromfear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone mayenjoy his economic, social and cultural rights as well as his civil and political rights.’Freedom from ‘fear and want’ should include conditions of life that start withthe ‘basic rights’ to ‘subsistence’ and ‘security’, as Shue describes them (Shue, 1996),that must include health and normal function, as well as a safe habitat able to supportboth. Below I return to the possibility of establishing in law third generation rights or‘solidarity rights’ (Downs, 1993). But the argument proposed here is clearly supportedby the Ogoni case, the case in Bhopal and in some measure, several other cases."

(Metcalf, 2004)This def i nition does not attempt to redef i ne ‘peoples’, but its meaning is clear regardingthe model and the sort of ‘peoples’ Metcalf intends to cover within this model. Inaddition, this def i nition is consonant with the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples, which includes one of the strongest statements of the rights ofindigenous peoples in the context of international law. 26At fi rst sight it may seem as though the emphasis on environmental land issuesmakes this model quite similar to the ‘cultural integrity’ model discussed above. But inthis model, indigenous peoples’ rights to their lands are based on their rights to controltheir own social life and development. A troubling corollary of this approach is thatthere is, at least in principle, no necessary connection between a group’s free choicesand any ecologically sound policy. However, Article 39 of the UN Draft Declarationstates:Indigenous peoples have the right to have access to and prompt decisions throughmutually acceptable and fair procedures for the resolution of conf l icts and disputeswith States, as well as to effective remedies for all infringements of their individual andcollective rights. Such a decision shall take into consideration the customs, traditions,rules, and legal system of the indigenous peoples concerned.Thus, at least this article recognizes the essential presence of ‘tradition’ and ‘customs’,although it stops short of making the presence of such traditional choices mandatoryin order to legitimize an indigenous people’s or First Nation’s choices.Perhaps this is the most disturbing aspect of this model. If self-determination is theultimate value, aside from any other consideration, then in theory (although most likelynot in practice), an aboriginal group could decide to rent their land to a Monsantoaff i liate, or a chemical company or any other hazardous industry, as long as it was thegeneral will of the people to do",

Aff i rming that the most serious crimes of concern to the internationalcommunity as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecutionmust be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancinginternational cooperation.When one considers the seriousness and the pervasiveness of the harms produced bythe combination of corporate ‘freedom’ to pursue its goals with few restraints, on onehand, and the primacy of trade ‘eff i ciency’ (Heath, 2001), on the other, we discoverthat all human rights are at stake.

Neither fi rst nor secondgeneration rights, ever mention health, either human or ecological, yet according tothe ‘Preamble’ of the latter: ‘The ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom fromfear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone mayenjoy his economic, social and cultural rights as well as his civil and political rights.’Freedom from ‘fear and want’ should include conditions of life that start withthe ‘basic rights’ to ‘subsistence’ and ‘security’, as Shue describes them (Shue, 1996),that must include health and normal function, as well as a safe habitat able to supportboth.

Individuals have to berecognized through a cosmopolitan approach to human rights before special groupsmay follow and expect to be considered separately and not only as part of a state party.The main point is that all these rights are fundamental, as well as interrelated.Hence they should be viewed as non-derogable, jus cogens rights, and the obligationsthey impose singly and jointly should be viewed as erga omnes, that is, beyond thelimited reach of state and domestic law, and even that of treaties limited to those whoare prepared to ratify them.
